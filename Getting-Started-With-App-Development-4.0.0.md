### Introduction

1. All applications are Python modules
1. Installation will by via `setuptools`
1. Apps communicate to base framework and other apps via `hooks.txt`
1. Important: DocType names and module names must be unique throughout all apps! So please check existing names before creating new apps / modules / doctypes

## Setting up the Environment

1. Setup a `virtualenv`.
1. Create your `bench` folder - which will contain the sites and apps.
1. In bench, you can create a separate folder for each app repository. Clone your `wnframework` and `erpnext` folders here. Please clone `wnframework` as `webnotes` - the repository name will be changed when the final release is complete.
1. In bench, create a `sites` folder for all sites to be served on this implementation.
1. Install `webnotes` and `erpnext` by running `python setup.py develop` in each folder.
1. Create `sites/apps.txt` for list of globally installable apps.
1. Create `sites/languages.txt` for installable languages. Copy from `webnotes/data/languages.txt`
1. For executing command line `webnotes` the working directory must be `sites`

Final Directory structure should be:

```
- bench
  + webnotes
  + erpnext
  - sites
    apps.txt
    languages.txt
    + assets
    + site1
    + site2
```

Sample `apps.txt`

```
webnotes
erpnext
```

### Installing for Development

- Setup each app (`webnotes`, `erpnext` etc) `python setup.py develop`
- Change to sites folder `bench/sites`
- run `webnotes site1 --install_db [dbname]`
- run `webnotes site1 --install_app erpnext`
- run `webnotes site1 --build`

To start serving

- From the sites folder: `webnotes site1 --serve`
## Creating a New App

1. Add setup.py
1. Add MANIFEST.IN
1. Add README
1. Create app folder
1. Add `[app]/__init__.py`
1. Add `[app]/hooks.txt`
1. Add `[app]/modules.txt`. List of modules in the app in code format (lowercase and no spaces)
1. Add `[app]/desktop.json`. List of desktop icons for the app.

### Hooks

Hooks are events that are called from `webnotes` or any application. Hooks.txt is a simple key value pair, with multiple values possible per key. Hooks could be values or routes to a function name depending on what the caller will do. There is no standard for a caller.

#### Application Name and Description

- `app_name`
- `app_description`
- `app_publisher`
- `app_color`
- `app_icons`

#### Installation

- `before_install` (method)
- `after_install` (method)

#### Build Includes

There are two javascript / css builds, one for the website and one for the application interface.

#### Scheduler

To run scheduled events, add scheduler hooks

#### Bean Events

These replace custom server scripts

Examples:

###### To execute a function after on_update of Quotation

Write a function in `app-repository-name.app_name.some_folder_hierarchy.some_py_file` module

    def do_this_stuff(controller, method_name):
        pass

Entry in hooks.txt

`bean_event = Quotation:on_update:app_name.some_folder_hierarchy.some_py_file.do_this_stuff`

### `desktop.json`

Sample:

```
{
	"Calendar": {
		"color": "#2980b9", 
		"icon": "icon-calendar", 
		"label": "Calendar", 
		"link": "Calendar/Event", 
		"type": "view"
	}, 
}
```

## Create a Module

An app is broken up into modules. Module name must be unique across applications.

1. Add list of modules in `[app]/modules.txt`
1. Create a Module Def record (from the UI)

#### Creating a DocType

1. Create a new DocType (New > DocType)
1. When you save, a folder will be created in the module with the document (`.txt`) file and a basic controller.
