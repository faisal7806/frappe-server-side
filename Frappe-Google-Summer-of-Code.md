##### Students
As per the timeline provided by [GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), students can begin applying between March 12, 2018 16:00 UTC to March 27, 2018 16:00 UTC. However if you'd like to start working on your proposal earlier, we watch out for a few things:

* You **MUST** prepare and send in at-least one Pull Request (more, the better) to any of the following repositories - [frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe), [erpnext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) or [bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench). There are tonnes of issues raised by our ardent community of users and developers, feel free to pick up any one. Ensure you've added the tag `GSoC` to your PR and a link to your application discussion (see [How do I apply?](#how-do-i-apply))
* **DO NOT** promise highly-ambitious goals and clearly let us know the amount of time you're keen to dedicate. (We're quite flexible that way!)

##### How do I apply?
You should raise a discussion on [discuss.erpnext.com](https://discuss.erpnext.com) under the Category - GSoC > Application. The post must contain your name, email and a quick description of what you're keen to work for this summer (if you're keen to work on any idea from the [Ideas List](#ideas-list), please mention it out). A prospective mentor should then get in touch with you. Talk to your mentor about what he/she expects from your application and accept feedback. It's advisable to follow recommendations provided by your mentor.

##### Ideas List
We've mentioned out a suggested list of ideas from which you might want to propose. Please feel free to submit proposals that aren't part of this list.

##### How do I connect?
You can shoot us an email at developers@frappe.io to connect with the Development Team. Or, you can raise a discussion (ideas, queries, etc.) at [discuss.erpnext.com](https://discuss.erpnext.com) with the **Category - GSoC > Discussion** (Preferable). Please make sure that the content of your discussion is crisp, clear and detailed (if required).
