This page is dedicated for **instructions** and **idea list** students wishing to apply for Google Summer of Code 2018 under our Organization (Frappe).

***NOTE***: As of January 23rd 2018, we're not sure whether we will be accepted for GSoC 2018. However, this is a definitive guide for you to know all about our organization and apply as a student developer for the same.

#### Google Summer of Code 2018
We're excited to announce that Frappe has applied as a Mentor Organization for Google Summer of Code 2018. To know more about this program, visit [summerofcode.google.com](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

##### Students
If you're keen to start on your proposals early, we'll be looking out for a few things.
* You'll need to have a concrete task in mind (some ideas are below) along with a solid idea of what will constitute "success" (you tell us).
* If your proposal is a single large feature, library or site, you'll need to present a detailed design specification. This proposal should be posted to ​discuss.erpnext.com, where it can be refined until it is accepted by the developer community.
* We'll want to know a bit about you -- links to previous work are great, if any. If you're proposing something ambitious, you'll need to convince us that you're up to the task.
* You'll also need to provide us with a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones so your mentor can know if and when to nag you :)

Note that none of the ideas below are good enough to be submissions in their own right (so don't copy and paste)! We'll want to know not just what you want to do but how you plan to pull it off.

Don't feel limited to the ideas below -- if you've got a cool project you want to work on, we'll probably be able to find you a mentor. We plan on approving as many projects as we possibly can.

We're accepting any GSOC proposal that fits one of the following three categories:

#### How can I improve my chances of being accepted?
The best thing you can do to improve your chances to be accepted as a Frappe GSoC student is to start contributing now. Read up on ​Frappe’s contribution documentation and make yourself known to the core team by your contributions (ideally, related to the area of your proposal). That way, when it comes time to evaluate student applications, you’ll be a known individual and more likely to be able to get the attention you need to develop a proposal.

#### Communication
All GSOC-related communication is handled via the ​discuss.erpnext.com mailing list. Any proposals for GSOC should be submitted there, as well as discussion on the proposed projects and any updates that students post.

Please be careful to keep content to the list clear and purposeful; if you have an idea, update, or criticism, please make sure you describe it in detail; it can be tedious asking people to clarify any vague statements.
